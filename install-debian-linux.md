The installer will then continue loading additional components. It will eventually start up the disk partitioner. We've allowed a generous default filesystem of up to 2 terabytes.

After the installer finishes configuring apt, it will ask about software selection; do not select any additional options; the default *should only be* **SSH server** and **standard system utilities** are selected and needed at this time. Uncheck 'Debian desktop environment' and 'GNOME' if checked by using the arrow keys and spacebar to select/unselect them.

* Make sure 'Software selection' is only 'SSH server' and 'standard system utilities', then press tab, and press enter to continue.

When the installer completes software installtion, it will continue with asking to install the GRUB boot loader, select Yes to continue and select the listed device, '/dev/vda'.

* At the finish the installation prompt, simply press enter to continue.

The installer will complete and start booting the operating system with the prompt "Booting 'Debian GNU/Linux'".

* At the login prompt login with the credentials login: debian, password: debian.
* Shutdown the machine via the command:
```
sudo poweroff
```

After machine powers off, the build script will continue to compress the image file along with relevant bios/efi image files into a single zip in your build folder (debian-arm64.zip or debian-amd64.zip). These prebuild archives can be found in the releases tab at https://github.com/virtuosoft-dev/qemu-debian/releases.
